# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — unreleased

Adoption discipline + TDD, closing the gaps vs superpowers.

- **using-smithy** meta-skill: skill routing table, priority rules,
  rationalization red-flags — injected into every session by the
  SessionStart hook (superpowers' adoption pattern)
- **jig** skill + **jigsmith** agent: first-class, choosable TDD path
  (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR per requirement, verbatim evidence, commit-per-stage,
  ordering verified by the inspector); `implementation.tdd: ask|always|never`
  config, editable via calibrate; bug fixes in anneal are always TDD
- Agents renamed to their skill verbs: `implementor→forger`,
  `code-reviewer→inspector`, `debugger→annealer`, `tester→temperer`
- Process-heavy skills expanded (budget raised 150→300 lines): mandatory
  checklists, red-flag rationalization tables, orchestrator process graph,
  decomposition rules in blueprint, finding-evaluation rules in inspect
- Review fixes: portable sed in review-package.sh, python3 guard + one-time
  malformed-config warning in routing.sh, PARTIAL ledger status, corrected
  forge example paths

  `inspect`, `anneal`, `temper`, `ring-test`, `wield`, `proof`, `hone`,
  `handover`, `calibrate`
